# Halfmoon-Contract


x_Beloved's absolute resignation and leave


--


A pretty lengthy message for those in this group who either love me, hate me, or would honestly want me dead lmao:
I've been apart of Halfmoon for a while now, even before it became its genre for whatever reason that may be and whatever motive my special mind may have, and holy shit, the only memorable trait I can remember here in this group is how long the pole here is up to people's asses in this group. Why is it most are you even serve Halfmoon anyway, most of the time people shit-post and say other stupid shit here yet for some reason it is me that gets punished and called out for it lmao? Groups are a way of unifying people under one banner and such, for things to be fun and enjoyable. Yet, Halfmoon used to be that. I didn't join Halfmoon personally to be in a group with depressed emo-like children whose puberty or period probably hasn't even hit them yet. I didn't join to continuously satisfy my daddies up in the leadership. I have my flaws, there were times I genuinely fucked up, but yet I seem to be the one who gets noticeably called out for it funny enough. I will say, I don't know if I will make a doc on this or not to go along with this, we'll see. Either way, the leadership in my opinion should be fixed up honestly, you can either take this document in or not, I couldn't careless in the end. I'll probably be exiled or I'll be gone in general by then. Either way, me messing around and toying with people shown me the true colors of people here in my eyes.


To:

Grimm: You're probably the only one who's the true leader of the group in my eyes, you need to take more control of it and lead its strength fully, don't be swayed by what others may think.

Wraith: Quit having the biggest stripper-pole up your ass. You're not tough, you're a child on the internet in my eyes honestly lol. I do admire how "tough" and "strict" you tend to be despite it simply coming to my end zzz

Hitman and the rest of the "staff" team: If you're not ready to be up for the task, Don't take it in the first place. Most of you guys are probably inexperienced and don't know what in the fuck you're doing honestly.

--Few thanks:

TheHalfmoonDarth: Despite you being a bigger crack than I was for the jokes, you made Halfmoon as fun as it was back then before it became this big of a mess.

Shadownote: You and I weren't always on good terms, but you sure as hell made Halfmoon a good time.

Vevvywick: You and spirit were honestly the few best of the Tyrs I've seen, (especially due to Grimm's heavy restriction on it: yawn) yet all in all, I enjoyed having your presence there, in my eyes, you were a better friend than spirit would ever be. Good-luck <3

XxDiamondWarriorxX: It's been ages since we've seen you here, I'm glad you were a former member, I should've left this group ages ago with you. This group is a curse honestly, but you and the very few people I've met here made this community amazing.
